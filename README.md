Renamepler
==========
This is a tool designed to do batch renaming of files, specifically with the use-case of renaming sample libraries kept in mind.
The user can search for strings, and set renaming patterns (with incremental numbers) for all matched files.  Regular expressions
can also be used in place of the search string.  These renaming "rules" can be saved and re-loaded later, along with results and
statistics from each search operation of the Renamepler.  This retroactive loading of the results allows the user to re-trace
what files used to be named, in the case of locating old samples.
